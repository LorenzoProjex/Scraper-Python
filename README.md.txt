Multi-page Python Scraper

This python script scrapes product names & prices from any given website, then outputs them to a .xlsx (excel) file.

The script also scrapes from multiple pages on a given website at once.

Say the website you want to scrape has 10 pages. The URL of the first product page is likely going to be something like "cycle.com/bikes/page1", and the 10th page is likely to be "cycle.com/bikes/page10". 

The script allows you to enter in as many pages as you desire. 

I'm new to coding, this is a noob project but it works. 

Thanks for using.
